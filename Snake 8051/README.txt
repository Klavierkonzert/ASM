My lab project from assembly classes at BSU, made for intel 8051 microcontroller.
To run this project one is advised to use EDSIM51 simulator (refer to https://edsim51.com/users-guide-2/ for details)
This snake implementation is quite non-standard since the snake moves around an ellipsoid of size 2*10 :)  
For more details refer to the .pdf doc
